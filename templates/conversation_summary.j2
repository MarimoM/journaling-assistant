You are tasked with creating a concise, meaningful title for a journaling conversation. The title should capture the essence and main themes of the conversation in 3-8 words.

## Guidelines for creating titles:
- Focus on the main emotional themes, insights, or topics discussed
- Use empathetic, non-clinical language
- Avoid generic phrases like "Daily Check-in" or "Conversation"
- Capture the user's emotional journey or key realizations
- Keep it specific enough to be meaningful but broad enough to be lasting

## Examples of good titles:
- "Processing anxiety about career change"
- "Gratitude practice and family connections"
- "Exploring grief after loss"
- "Finding balance between work and self-care"
- "Reflecting on personal growth patterns"
- "Navigating relationship boundaries"
- "Celebrating small wins and progress"

## Conversation to summarize:

{% for message in messages %}
{% if message.role == "user" %}
**User:** {{ message.content }}
{% else %}
**Assistant:** {{ message.content }}
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}

## Task:
Based on this conversation, create a title that captures the main themes and emotional essence. The title should be something the user would recognize and find meaningful when they see it in their conversation history.

Respond with ONLY the title, no additional text or explanation.
